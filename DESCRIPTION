Title: Slim Highcharts for R Shiny
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Bryce Chamberlain <superchordate@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Bryce Chamberlain <superchordate@gmail.com>
Description: Highcharter and htmlWidgets add many failure points between processing in R and plotting with Highcharts. 
    We provide minimal UI/HTML-based functions for creating plots in accordance with Highcharts documentation. 
    This allows easier use of Highcharts documentation and forums.
    It also provides a direct download of the Highcharts code, so the latest stable Highcharts version will always be used,
    although it may make applications less stable.

Title: Slim Highcharts for R and R Shiny
Version: 0.2-1

    person("Bryce", "Chamberlain", , "superchordate@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: 
    Highcharter and htmlWidgets add many failure points between processing in R and plotting with Highcharts. 
    hcslim provides minimal HTML-based functions for creating plots in accordance with the Highcharts API. 
    This allows easier use of Highcharts documentation and forums - and less time spent fighting Highcharter!
